              <ul>
             <li><p>The term “Leave of Absence” (LOA) refers to an absence from the university. Students on LOA are not enrolled in any course, 
                 are not considered bonafide students, and are not allowed to enter the campus except as occasional visitors to transact with certain offices.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, students on LOA are not permitted to enroll and study in another educational institution. No course taken by students 
                on LOA from another school may be credited towards the completion of the program in this university.
                <br><br>
                Undergraduate students are assumed to enroll on a continuous basis until their program is completed. Any break in enrollment 
                requires the filing of a Leave of Absence. An approved LOA is a permission from the university to temporarily interrupt studies. 
                As a general rule, it carries with it an implied guarantee to accept the student as a returnee, subject to other policies of the university.</p></li>
              </ul>

              <hr class="new4">

            <p><b>The following are the guidelines on filing for a leave of absence:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li><p> The College, through the Dean or the duly authorized representative, shall inform the University Registrar and the parents/guardian of every student granted 
                    leave of absence, indicating the reasons for the leave and the amount of money refunded to the student, if any</p></li>
                <li><p> For a leave of absence to be availed of by the student himself/herself, during the second half of the semester, faculty members concerned shall be required to 
                    indicate the class standing of the student (“Passing” or “Failing”) at the time of the application for the leave. No application for leave of absence shall be approved 
                    without the class standing being indicated by the instructors concerned. This class standing, however, should not be entered in the official Report of Grades</p></li>
                <li><p> No leave of absence shall be granted during the semester within two (2) weeks before the last day of classes. 
                    If the inability of the student to continue classes is for reasons of health or similar justifiable causes, the absence during this period shall be considered excused. 
                    In such cases, the students shall be required to apply for excuse from the absences. It shall be the responsibility of the student to present an excuse slip to the faculty 
                    members concerned</p></li>
              </ul>
